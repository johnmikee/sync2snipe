# Acknowledgements
The fancy looking gifs in the main [README](../README.md) were made using two wonderful tools
* [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs)
* [t-rec-rs](https://github.com/sassman/t-rec-rs)

# Use
To create the vhs gifs for the [README](../README.md) do the following:
![Alt Text](gifs/vhs.gif)
* pass the tape as the first arguement and the output as the second arguement.

# Note
The process shown above is only required if the vhs tape interacts with a script at the top-level of the repo to show output.
Otherwise, you can simply run `vhs new.tape`.
